# ✍️ Task 4 – Text Generation using GPT-2

This project is part of my **CodTech AI Internship**.  
The goal is to develop a text generation tool using a pre-trained language model that can generate coherent paragraphs from a prompt.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a system that:
- Accepts a prompt from the user
- Uses a GPT-2 model to generate a continuation
- Outputs readable, structured text
- Offers an option to save the output

---

## 🚀 How It Works

This project uses the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library.

### ✅ Key Features:
- Accepts custom user prompt
- Generates text up to a specified maximum length
- Uses sampling techniques like top-k
- Allows saving generated text to a file

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

---

## 🧠 How to Run

```bash
python text_generator.py
```

You will be prompted to:
- Enter a starting prompt
- Optionally choose a maximum length
- View and optionally save the output

---

## 🧪 Example

### ✍️ Prompt:
```
He opened the door and saw something unexpected:
```

### 📃 Output:
```
He opened the door and saw something unexpected: a man in a white shirt and a black shirt.
He was wearing a red shirt, black pants, and black shoes.
"I was just shocked," he said. "I thought he was a terrorist..."
```

> *Note: Output is model-generated and can include fictional or sensitive information.*
